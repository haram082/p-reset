FA23: p-reset (AI-powered Personalized Self-Care Web Application)


### Description
 This project will create a fully functional self care web application with AI-based recommendations for personal wellness, incorporating features such as break reminders, habit and mood tracking, journaling, and calendar integration. Combining both software engineering and traditional data science elements, we will also implement smart scheduling of wellness activities, use NLP techniques to analyze journal entries, and develop personalized visualizations from user data. The aim is to have an assistant that learns from a userâ€™s past activity to make smart recommendations and optimize time management to include self care tasks.

 The p-reset application is a unique blend of software engineering and traditional data science methodologies, designed to deliver a personalized self-care experience. It leverages a variety of cutting-edge technologies to provide intelligent recommendations and perform comprehensive user data analysis. The p-reset application utilizes a full-stack development approach, combining both frontend and backend technologies. The frontend is built with Next.js, a React framework, and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and professional user interface. The backend is developed using Python and Flask, with SQLAlchemy serving as the interface for the PostgreSQL database. The p-reset application is a sophisticated blend of modern web development and data science technologies, all working in harmony to create a personalized and engaging self-care experience for users.
